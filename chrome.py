"""The house style, inside a notebook.

Launchpad executes this notebook **once, at build time**, and serves the HTML
that fell out. There is no kernel behind the published page, so the only way to
style it from inside the notebook is to have a cell emit the stylesheet — which
is what :func:`masthead` does.

It lives in a module rather than in the notebook because nbconvert's ``lab``
template shows every code cell's source, and Launchpad runs that template on
purpose: it is what *File → Export as HTML* produces, so the deployed page
matches the one the author already looked at. A notebook app therefore shows its
working, and eighty lines of CSS at the top of the document would be the first
thing anybody read. Two lines and an import is the right size for the first cell.
